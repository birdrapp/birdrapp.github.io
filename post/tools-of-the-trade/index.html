<p><img src="/images/post/tools-of-the-trade.jpg" alt="A set of old wood working tools... totally unsuitable for web development" /></p>

<p>When I initially built Birdr in 2011, I built it using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. These were new technologies to me at the time and required a substantial amount of learning. Birdr is a great project for learning new technologies. It is complex enough to require me to have a firm grasp of a language, yet remains simple enough to allow me to produce <em>something</em> relatively quickly.</p>

<p>To this day, Ruby remains my favourite programming language. It has a satisfying syntax and malleable design, which lets you create code that reads almost like prose. I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to use it in my day job yet, but it is my go-to tool for personal projects. If you are interested in programming and haven&rsquo;t tried Ruby yet, I would <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/rails5/agile-web-development-with-rails-5">strongly encourage you to do so</a>&hellip; you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<p>Rails is a framework built on Ruby that allows a developer to get up and running extremely quickly. It became famous for it&rsquo;s &ldquo;How to build a blog in 15 minutes&rdquo; tutorial. However, the best thing about Rails, in my opinion, is the community. There is a strong focus on testing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> within the Rails community - both good practices and something I strongly believe in. Furthermore, there are packages, or <a href="https://rubygems.org/">Gems</a>, for nearly anything. From <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/devise/versions/4.2.0">user authentication</a> to <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/darksky/versions/1.0.5">weather reports</a> - Rails has it all.</p>

<h3 id="out-with-the-old-and-in-with-the-new">Out with the old and in with the new</h3>

<p>Ruby on Rails is very much the kitchen sink of development. This time around I am looking to adopt a pattern that I used successfully at the BBC - <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Microservices</a>. At a high level, the idea behind Microservices is that you split your application into smaller, logical chunks. What used to be a single monolithic application becomes a loosely coupled web of services that form a whole. For an architecture such as this, Rails does not make sense.</p>

<p>There are a number of problems posed by using Microservices too. Deploying, monitoring and maintaining multiple services rather than 1 can be a heavy burden on a team. These are all things that I will try to solve and document during the development of Birdr. To help me, I have provisionally selected a number of technologies.</p>

<h4 id="docker-kubernetes">Docker &amp; Kubernetes</h4>

<p>Containers. You can&rsquo;t avoid them nowadays. The rise of <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> has been one of the quickest I can remember. I didn&rsquo;t use it at the BBC, partly due to the maturity of the project and partly due to other constraints. However, with tools such as <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> (k8s) emerging, containers have become a far more compelling proposition. I will use Birdr as an opportunity to work with k8s and Docker to host the Microservices that I develop.</p>

<h4 id="go">Go</h4>

<p>Another popular technology at the moment is <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> (or Golang). Developed by Google, it is a compiled, statically typed language. For the non-techies among you, this means it is worlds apart from Ruby - which is an interpreted, dynamically typed language. As it is substantially different to any language I have used recently it will place me firmly outside of my comfort zone.</p>

<h4 id="linkerd">linkerd</h4>

<p>Building a Microservice architecture introduces a lot more communication. What was once an internal function call becomes a network request. And, as anyone will tell you, networks are inherently unreliable. Requests will fail or slow down seemingly at random, which can cause catastrophic failures when you&rsquo;re operating at scale. There are a number of tools at your disposal to help you build a <em>robust</em> system such as circuit breakers, retries and bulkheads. At the BBC we built a Node.js library (<a href="https://github.com/bbc/flashheart">which has since been open sourced</a>) to handle this for us. The downside of this approach is that it limits you to using Node.js. To create a Microservice in another language would require you to write a similar library. This is an anti-pattern covered in detail in <a href="https://www.microservices.com/talks/dont-build-a-distributed-monolith/">this talk by Ben Christensen</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative approach I <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2016/09/19/building-a-modern-bank-backend/">discovered being used by Monzo</a> is to use a service called <a href="https://linkerd.io/">linkerd</a>. Essentially, your services communicate with linkerd, which is running locally and <em>it</em> handles communication across the network - including retries, circuit breakers and monitoring.</p>

<p>I hadn’t heard about this before, so I am really excited to try it out and see how it works.</p>

<h4 id="prometheus">Prometheus</h4>

<p>The final technology I want to call out is <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>. When you&rsquo;re running 20+ services in production, monitoring is essential. I&rsquo;ve had great success using <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">StatsD</a> and <a href="https://graphiteapp.org/">Graphite</a> before but wanted to take this opportunity to try something different.</p>

<p>No doubt there will be other technologies I will want or need to use during the next year. One of the benefits of building using Microservices and linkerd is that I am free to choose the language of my choice. I hope I manage to avoid the inevitable lure of returning to my comfort zone with Ruby.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note: If you&rsquo;re reading this and don&rsquo;t understand a word I&rsquo;ve just said - fear not. I hope to blog about each of these technologies individually at a level that even my dad could understand&hellip; and he&rsquo;s about as technical as a Woodpigeon!</em></strong></p>
